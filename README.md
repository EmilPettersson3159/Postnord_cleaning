# Postnord_cleaning
Cleaning of data set using Python and visualizing it in Tableau.
This is one of the earlier projects I made, in which I prepared a dataset by collecting different files together and cleaning it in Python. The cleaned dataset was exported and used in Tableau to create a working and interactive dashboard. I did everything myself in what is presented, i.e. preparing the dataset and visualizing on certain parameters through creating a working dashboard. The following elements are appended to the drive link below:
- A Tableau workbook file (containing the dashboard and all the sheets as proof)
- The data in its raw form
- The final, cleaned data in a CSV file
- A short video presentation of me going through the dashboard's features

It should be noted that the dataset is quite big in size, around 2gb I believe.

Note: I realize that the Python script is quite messy, but I have become far better at setting up a proper structure that makes it more readable and easier to follow, especially through an approach that includes functions way more. The reason I chose this project to showcase is because it showcases my ability to both prepare a dataset and visualize it.
